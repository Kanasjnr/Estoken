## Overview

Estoken is a revolutionary real estate tokenization platform built on the CrossFI blockchain. Our mission is to democratize property investment by enabling fractional ownership through blockchain technology. This platform allows middle-income investors, real estate enthusiasts, and developers to participate in property markets without requiring significant capital.

### Key Concepts

- *Property Tokenization*: Real estate properties are divided into shares, each represented as ERC-20 or ERC-1155 tokens on the blockchain.
- *Fractional Ownership*: Investors can own a portion of high-value properties, lowering the barrier to entry for real estate investment.
- *Blockchain Technology*: Utilizing CrossFI blockchain for secure, transparent, and efficient property transactions and management.
- *Smart Contracts*: Automated systems for token issuance, ownership transfer, and rental income distribution.

## Project Goals

1. *Smart Contract Development*
   - Create secure smart contracts for property tokenization and fractional ownership management.
   - Implement automated rental income distribution to token holders.

2. *Property Tokenization System*
   - Develop a robust backend to map property shares to blockchain tokens.
   - Create a peer-to-peer trading system for property tokens on a secondary marketplace.

3. *User-Friendly Interfaces*
   - Build intuitive web and mobile interfaces for property browsing, token purchasing, and investment monitoring.
   - Provide real-time updates on property performance and token valuation.

4. *Transparency and Compliance*
   - Ensure full transparency in property management and investment tracking.
   - Implement KYC/AML processes and adhere to real estate regulations.

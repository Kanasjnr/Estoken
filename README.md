# Estoken: Real Estate Tokenization Platform

<!-- ![Estoken Logo](https://placeholder.com/path-to-your-logo.png) -->

Estoken is a comprehensive blockchain-based real estate investment platform that democratizes property ownership through fractional tokenization. Built on Base Sepolia, Estoken transforms traditional real estate investment by enabling anyone to own, trade, and earn from property assets through NFT-backed fractional shares.

- **Trade Property Shares** on our integrated secondary marketplace
- **Monitor Investments** through comprehensive analytics and portfolio management tools
